\title{Estimate rounding error based on given sample of metric values
The idea is to check at which level of rounding the sample values do not change.}
\usage{
estimRoundingError(obs, roundDigits = seq.int(-4L, 6L), maxObs = 100L)
}
\arguments{
\item{obs}{numeric. Metric values from a sample to estimate the corresponding rounding error}

\item{roundDigits}{integer. Which level of rounding to test? Negative numbers round to corresponding powers of 10}

\item{maxObs}{integer. How many observations to consider at most? If the provided sample has more observations a sub-sample is used.}
}
\value{
estimated rounding error
}
\description{
Estimate rounding error based on given sample of metric values
