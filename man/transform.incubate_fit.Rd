\title{Transform observed data to unit interval}
\usage{
\method{transform}{incubate_fit}(`_data`, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{_data}{a fitted model object of class \code{incubate_fit}}

\item{...}{currently ignored}
}
\value{
The transformed data, either a vector (for single group) or a list with entries x and y (in two group scenario)
}
\description{
The transformation is the probability integral transform. It uses the cumulative distribution function with the estimated parameters of the model fit.
All available data in the model fit is transformed.
}
\note{
This S3-method implementation is quite different from its default method that allows for non-standard evaluation on data frames, primarily for interactive use.
But the name \code{transform} just fits so nicely to the intended purpose that it is re-used for the probability integral transform.
